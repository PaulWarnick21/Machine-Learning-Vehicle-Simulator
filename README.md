# Capstone - Machine Learning Vehicle Simulator

## Build Instructions

In order to run the project clone this repo using git or download directly to your computer

Once downloaded

1) Ensure you have Node.JS installed via [the download site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2) Enter the directory of the repo via terminal and type `npm install`
3) Once complete type `nodemon` to start the app
4) Visit [http://127.0.1.1:6001](http://127.0.1.1:6001) in a browser to see the simulation running
5) In order to reset the simulation go back to terminal and type `rs` and hit enter

In the current state of the project, 50 cars are being simulated using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. In the future, we intend to add functionality that will allow other developers to input their own smart car algorithms for testing within our simulator.
